# entityHurt-beforeEvent
Mojang is not gonna add entityHurtBeforeEvent in bedrock Script API, so we added it!!

This is a custom event, that adds a prototype in the WorldBeforeEvents class.

We came up on the idea on, why can't we cancel entity damage?
So we found a workaround, and implemented it.
This will add alot of possibilities in making addons with Script API.
